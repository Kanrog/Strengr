<p><em>First of, a little disclaimer: This product involves changing the electronics of your printer, do this at your own risk, we are not responsible for any damages that might occur.</em></p>

<p>Strengr (Old-norse word for "Rope"), was created by Kanrog and Automated Neurotic.</p>
<p>The Idea behind this project was to make an easy solution for those who want to move all the electronics on their printer away from it, usually to enclose the printer.</p>
<p>Instead of extending all the wires, soldering, re-pinning, etc, simply plug them into one of the Strengr boards, connect 2 DVI cables and the heater wires, then connect another Strengr board on the other end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are limitations to this design, the main one being power delivery to the steppers, we have set a max current draw of 1.5A, we do not recommend going any higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strengr board is identical at both ends, meaning the USB-A plugs are also the same. We recommend aquiring a pair of USB-A male-male cables to connect to the board.</p>
